# plush
a minimal shell that doesn't have any extra overhead nonsense.
first shell project without using any external resources

## the path ahead
not sure what I want to do with this project, but whatever I'll do, I'll make sure it's good.
I might end up redoing this as I believe I didn't implement things in the best way and it's not very optimized

## how to use it
launch the plush.exe file to open the shell, view commands with 'help'
