# plush
a minimal shell that doesn't have any extra overhead nonsense.
first shell project without using any external resources

## the path ahead
not sure what I want to do with this project, but whatever I'll do, I'll make sure it's good.
I might end up redoing this as I believe I didn't implement things in the best way and it's not very optimized
## todo
- .plush file support (line by line command file)
- add general commands (wcount, ccount, binary, memory, cpu, list)
- add more arithmetic commands
- fix incorrect argument behaviour

## how to use it
launch the plush.exe file to open the shell, view commands with 'help'
